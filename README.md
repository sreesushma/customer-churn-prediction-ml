- Feature engineering
- Model training using Random Forest
- Model evaluation
- Insight generation using visual analytics
## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers with short tenure show higher churn risk
- Contract type and service usage strongly impact churn
- Feature importance improves model interpretability

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
